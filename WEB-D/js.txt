      -------------------------ALL ABOUT ASYNC JS------------------------------

As js is a synchronous,blocking,single-threaded language
SYNCHRONOUS: only one line of code is excecuted at once
BLOCKING: no matter how long it takes the subsequent process wont kick off untill the former is completed
SINGLE-THREADED: js calls only one task at a time so number of thread is nothing but the number of tasks performed at a time 

WE SHOULD USE WEB BROWSERS AND API'S THAT ALLOWS THE CODE TO RUN ASYNCRONOUSLY

CALL-BACKS: 
        any function that is passed as an argument to another function is called a callback finction in js
        as we pass more and more functions the code becomes unreadable so developers given this term as callback hell
        callbacks can be both sunchronous and asyncronous depending upon user's usecase
        to tackle the callback hell we use something called promises
PROMISES:
        a promise is simply an object in JS
        a promise is always in one of the three states
            pending: which is initial state,neither fulfilled nor rejected
            fulfilled: means that the operation completed successfully
            rejected: meaning that the operation failed
      to avoid callback hells we use promises  
      promises are objects and are always called using constructor function 
      promises can be chained
